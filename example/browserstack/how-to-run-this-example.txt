BrowserStack Example

THIS EXAMPLE CURRENTLY HAS PROBLEMS -- IT WILL PROBABLY NOT WORK [ot 1/19/2013]

Sauce Labs is a cloud provider of browsers. Queen issue request to Sauce to automatically
populate itself with browsers. To do that we'll start a download and start a local tunnel to the Sauce Labs cloud,
then run queen with the configuration defined in queenConfig.js.

Once Queen starts, it will connect to the Sauce Labs service and request that it spawns a Firefox browser
and points it at it's capture url. Once the browser is connected, Queen will automatically run the
server-side script defined at http://queenjs.com/server-example.js. 

The configuration options are defined in queenConfig.js.

To run this example:
1) Download http://www.browserstack.com/BrowserStackTunnel.jar
2) Edit queenConfig.js with your Browser Stack user name and access key
3) Run this command to start Queen: node ../../bin/queen
4) Run this command to start Browser Stack Tunnel: java -jar BrowserStackTunnel.jar [YOUR BROWSER STACK LOCAL TESTING KEY] localhost,9300,0
