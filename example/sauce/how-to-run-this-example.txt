Sauce Labs Example

Sauce Labs is a cloud provider of browsers. Queen issue request to Sauce to automatically
populate itself with browsers. To do that we'll start a download and start a local tunnel to the Sauce Labs cloud,
then run queen with the configuration defined in queenConfig.js.

Once Queen starts, it will connect to the Sauce Labs service and request that it spawns a Firefox browser
and points it at it's capture url. Once the browser is connected, Queen will automatically run the
server-side script defined at http://queenjs.com/server-example.js. 

The configuration options are defined in queenConfig.js.

To run this example:
1) Download http://saucelabs.com/downloads/Sauce-Connect-latest.zip
2) Extract "Sauce-Connect.jar"
3) Run this command to start Sauce Connect: java -jar Sauce-Connect.jar [YOUR SAUCE LABS USER NAME] [YOUR SAUCE LABS ACCESS KEY]
4) Edit queenConfig.js with your Sauce labs user name and access key
5) Run this command to start Queen: node ../../bin/queen
