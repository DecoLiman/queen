Selenium Grid Example

To run this example:
1) Download http://selenium.googlecode.com/files/selenium-server-standalone-2.28.0.jar in to this directory
2) Run this command to start the Grid hub: java -jar selenium-server-standalone-2.28.0.jar -role hub -hubConfig hub.json
3) Run this command to start a Grid node: java -jar selenium-server-standalone-2.28.0.jar -role node -hubConfig node.json
4) Run this command to start Queen: node ../../bin/queen

Selenium is a web browser driver. Queen can connect to a Selenium Grid in order to automatically
populate itself with browsers. To do that we'll start a Selenium Grid hub and node on this machine,
then run queen with the configuration defined in queenConfig.js.

Once Queen starts, it will connect to the Selenium hub and request that it spawns a Firefox browser
and points it at it's capture url. Once the browser is connected, Queen will automatically run the
server-side script defined at http://queenjs.com/server-example.js. 

The configuration options are defined in queenConfig.js.
